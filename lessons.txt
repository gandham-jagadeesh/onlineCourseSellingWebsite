problem 1: files not uploading to s3 timedout

reason 1 : in controller i saved to disk as i am using multer disk storage
so file which i am passing to the s3.uploadfile() will not contains file.buffer as its empty
so thats the reason its timing out
if i used  in memory the buffer stays the same with in the file
